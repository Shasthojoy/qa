# QA

QA is an awesome **in development** Q&A engine.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

        git clone git://github.com/thomas-mcdonald/qa.git
    
2. Bundle install

        bundle install

3. (optional) Import the SE data dump of your choice. 

 Move the data into lib/importdata and run `rake import:all`. Would recommend against using a site with a larger than 10mb compressed dump, as it will take ages. Literally.

4. Link to Pow or run `rails s`
